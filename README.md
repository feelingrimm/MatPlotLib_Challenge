 accidentally messed up where i put the repo...i hope that doesn't affect any pushing


EDIT:  yeah i had to scratch the repo and start all over with the github side of things...I was pushing to a folder that I wasn't aware a I had as a repo rather than the repo I intended to push to.

I tried to heavily work on commenting this go around.  That was a suggestion from my last grader and Stephen as well as Matt.

Hopefully it's all cohearant.
